# GUI Frame Diff  (AMOS WS 2023)

## About

**Library 1**

- It operates on the head unit (Android Auto), necessitating high efficiency.
- It processes a batch of images obtained from a single test run.
- Screenshots, encompassing all different system states, are generated on the head unit.
- A single video file is created from the batch of images received.

**Library 2**

- This library accepts two videos from two test runs as input.
- It calculates the difference between these two videos.
- The resulting image difference is then saved as a video.

**Library 3**
- Is the final GUI, that should look like a video editing tool  
- Can show the two input videos and the frame diff 

## Coding Guidelines ðŸ’…

- Use the Kotlin coding style defined here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html
- Use ktlint to ensure a uniform coding style.

### Setup 

Install ktlint: https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/1.0.1/install/cli/

We have a pre-commit hook that runs ktlint. Please activate it as follows:
1. Run `git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks` in the root directory of the project.
2. Mark the hook as executable: `chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit`

It makes sense to run `ktlint` more often to prevent a lot of formatting errors from piling up.
It is also encouraged to use an on-save formatter as provided by IDEs like IntelliJ, Android Studio and VS Code.

### License Checking

The project uses a [gradle plugin](https://github.com/jk1/Gradle-License-Report) to generate
dependency license reports. The reports are all saved in the `./licenses/reports/` directory.
Currently, we are allowing the licenses `MIT` and `Apache 2.0`. This information can be changed
in `./licenses/allowed-licenses.json`

For `lib1`:
- *to be implemented*

For `lib2` (analogous for the `gui`):
- Run a task that fails if dependencies with non-allowed licenses are found.
- `cd ./DifferenceGenerator/ && ./gradlew checkLicense`
- Generate a license report in html
- `cd ./DifferenceGenerator/ && ./gradlew generateLicenseReport`
- The report will be available at `./licenses/reports/DifferenceGenerator/`
